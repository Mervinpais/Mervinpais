C# = 60%
Python = 25%
html = 15%

Html was the first language i learned
C# was 2nd
Python was 3rd

I LOVE C#
i have love/Hate relations with python
im just nutral with html

i love C# more because of Winforms because it allows me to make apps without doing the hard work of addressing win32 dll's to make a window :D
