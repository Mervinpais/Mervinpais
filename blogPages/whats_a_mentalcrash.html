    <p>Whats a 'Mental Crash'? MentalCrash is a(n) (Eso) Programming language i made to try and make a language which we can code in one line, ONLY</p>
    <p>Although, we can write our program in multiple lines</p>

    <p style="align: center; font-size: x-large">Nerd Ack: "Uhm Acktually that defets dhe whol purpos of yur program becuz u shoud maik it soo it ONLY one lien ruhns"</p>
    <p>But that would be impractical because it would be;</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Hard to read</li>
        <li>Not easy to maintain</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Here is how you would write a <b>Hello world!</b> program in MentalCrash</p>

    <div class="code-container">
        <div class="code-top-bar">
            <span class="language">MentalCrash (v-0.2)</span>
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode()">Copy</button>
        </div>
        <div style="background-color: rgba(25, 25, 25, 1);">
            <br />
            <code class="custom-code">p Hello World!</code><br /><br />
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>This is not that hard;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First, we split the first space, so 'p' and 'Hello World!'</li>
        <br />
        <li>Second, we go through each list of command and their argumentment, so here, 'p' is the (only) command (here), and 'Hello World!' is the (only) argument (here)</li>
        <br />
        <li>Third, We do whatever command needs to do with whatever argument/parameter it has, here p uses the first parameter, since its the first command, 'p' is eqivalent to 'print()' in python, or 'Console.WriteLine();' in C#.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Finally, then go on with the other commands till the end, then after the program will turn into a shell, unless there is a '.' command, and at the '.' command, we stop the program, even with other commands after it</li>
        <br />
    </ul>
    <p>Wow, its not <b><i>*that*</i></b> hard</p>

    <p>Now i have written a python program that generates for us random MentalCrash Code (Link: &lt;insert_link_here&gt;)</p>
    <div class="code-container">
        <div class="code-top-bar">
            <span class="language">MentalCrash (v-0.2)</span>
            <button class="copy-button" onclick="copyCode()">Copy</button>
        </div>
        <div style="background-color: rgba(25, 25, 25, 1);">
            <br />
            <code class="custom-code">Idpdadspdp. qAlXP == eRZS|p True |p False |[6,0]|, Mi\iz''*j}}e/,Hh|[9,4]|[6,7]|[4,0]|[5,3]| , }_ ',J,Y( [,\,'q,|[10,4]|,'x[q|</code><br /><br />
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Note that this code only works in MentalCrash Version 0.2, as Version 0.3 will use '"' (Double Quotes) to denote strings, because in Version(s) V-0.1 and V-0.2 there was no real way to denote strings and variables, the only way to tell the difference was with using 'V' at the start of a variable, but it doesnt work always so it will be reworked in V-0.3 of Mental Crash</p>

    <p>But yeah back to things, With this code, its really hard to understand what is going on here.. so i guess good naming for the programming language??</p>

    <h3>EXTRA NOTES</h3>
    <p>Im not really sure if you can consider MentalCrash (or any of my other programming languages) as Eso-Langs</p>

    <p>But yeah, this was basically MentalCrash</p>
